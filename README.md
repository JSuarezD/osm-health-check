## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before getting started with OSM Health Check, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements and has the necessary tools configured.

### Test Environment

The project has been validated and tested with the following component versions:

| **Component** | **Version** |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `python -V`   | `3.14+`     |

### Configuring project (`pre-commit`) 

Install the development dependencies from `pyproject.toml` which includes `pre-commit`. The `pre-commit` configuration is designed to enforce that all commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

> [!TIP]
> The following commands should be executed within a Python virtual environment.

```bash
poetry install --with dev
pre-commit autoupdate
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-push
```
Once the environment is configured, the FastAPI server can be launched:

```bash
poetry run fastapi dev main.py
```
